<P>hospital, an institution that is built, staffed, and equipped for the diagnosis of disease; for the treatment, 
  both medical and surgical, of the sick and the injured; and for their housing during this process. 
  The modern hospital also often serves as a centre for investigation and for teaching.</P>
  <h1>Services</h1>
  <p>Hospitals have long existed in most countries. Developing countries, which contain a large proportion of the worldâ€™s 
    population, generally do not have enough hospitals, equipment, and trained staff to handle the volume of persons who need care. 
    Thus, people in these countries do not always receive the benefits of modern medicine, 
    public health measures, or hospital care, and they generally have lower life expectancies.</p>
